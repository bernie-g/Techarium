To run this in dev, you'll need to clone the repository and open it in your IDE. For whatever reason Techarium hates OpenJDK and will go to like 5 FPS while debugging, so I'd recommend using Zulu or Amazon Corretto.
After you load the project, run `gradlew genIntellijRuns`. Then press the start button next to `runClient`.
