To run this in dev, you'll need to clone the repository and open it in your IDE. Java 11 is prefered as there's some weird bug with some distributions of JDK 8 that prevent Techarium from compiling. 

After you load the project, run `gradlew genIntellijRuns`. Then press the start button next to `runClient`.
